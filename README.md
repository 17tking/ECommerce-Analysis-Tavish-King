# Olist E-commerce Business Analysis

Welcome! This project explores sales, customer behavior, delivery logistics, and product trends using the Olist e-commerce dataset from Brazil. Through SQL and R, I uncovered key insights that could inform business decisions, marketing strategies, and operational improvements.

---

## Project Objective

To analyze the Brazilian e-commerce landscape using Olist data, focusing on:
- Customer satisfaction and delivery performance
- Website engagement and product diversity in orders
- Geographic trends in demand and accessibility
- Product category performance and bundling opportunities

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (PostgreSQL)**: Data querying, CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregations, Subqueries, etc...
- **R (tidyverse, ggplot2, more+)**: Data wrangling, cleaning, visualization, modeling, and exploratory analysis

---

## Key Insights

- **Delivery time is critical**: Customers are more satisfied when products arrive faster — long delays directly correlate with poor review scores.
- **Low website engagement**: Customers often buy only one type of item per order. The platform lacks recommendations or bundling nudges.
- **Supply chain strain**: Large orders experience more issues, hinting at warehouse inefficiencies or multi-vendor delays.
- **Geographic divide**: São Paulo dominates sales volume, but high order values from rural states suggest untapped demand hindered by poor infrastructure.
