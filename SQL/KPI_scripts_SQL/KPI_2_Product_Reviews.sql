-- KPI #2: Product Review Analysis

-- The Product Strategy team has asked me to analyze customer reviews 
-- to identify the key factors influencing product rating scores (1â€“5). 
-- The goal is to understand what drives higher satisfaction and uncover 
-- any patterns that could inform product improvements, pricing, or 
-- service enhancements.

-- Each order has a review score. However, some orders have multiple products.
-- Therefore, I am behaving as if each product has that review score. For example,
-- three products in a 4-star order will each be a 4-star rating.

-- distribution of reviews (share of star ratings)

-- tot_price, payment_value, order_size, delivery_days v. review scores
-- (calculated at the order level)
-- note: there were errors with order_approved_at having a later timestamp
-- then the delivery date, creating negative values (impossible). 
-- Therefore, I used order_purchase_timestamp instead. No negative values and still usable.
